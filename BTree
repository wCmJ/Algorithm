m rank B-Tree
In every node, number of element between m/2 up -1 ~ m-1, min = m/2 up -1, max = m-1
vector<T> ele[n];
vector<Node*> p[n+1];

insert:
    find location in the leaf level
    insert new element to vector ele
    while size is greater than max
        pick the mid one and inserted to up level until to root.
    return
    
remove:
    find the ele, and get its succ.
    exchange these two ele
    remove the succ
    after remove
    if size is less than min,
        1. get its brother node that size is greater than min,
            transfer one ele between this.
